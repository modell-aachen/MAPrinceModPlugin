---++ Usage
This Plugin is designed to work along with GenPDFPrincePlugin and check image permissions.
<p>It will rewrite the source in img-tags to reference to local files on the server eg. =img src='/bin/viewfile/Main/Topic/MyPicture.png'= will become =img src='file:///path/to/Foswiki/pub/Main/Topic/MyPicture.png'= *IF* the user has the required permissions to view that file.
</p>
When access is denied the image will be replaced with an error-image. You can set that image in configure.

---++ Customization
---+++ Customizing the page
You will need to create a =ModacPrintLayoutTemplate= in your customizing skin, eg. =Custom.CustomSkinModacPrintLayoutTemplate=. You can use [[%SYSTEMWEB%.ModacPrintLayoutTemplate][%SYSTEMWEB%.ModacPrintLayoutTemplate]] as template and remove the options you do not need.
| *Definition* | *Explanation* | *Format to use* |
| *layout* |||
| =printHeaderHeight= | This is the height of the header. | _css_, eg. =50px;= |
| =printFooterHeight= | This is the height of the footer. | _css_, eg. =50px;= |
| =printLeftMargin= | This is the left margin of the page. | _css_, eg. =2cm;= |
| =printRightMargin= | This is the right margin of the page. | _css_, eg. =1cm;= |
| =printFormat= | Paper size | A4, letter, etc. |
| *header/footer* |||
| =Princeheader= | This is the content of the header and will normally consist of =%%NOP%TMPL:P{"top"}%= | _TML_ |
| =Princefooter= | This is the content of the footer and will normally consist of a line and some text below.%BR%If you only want to modify the text you most likely want to look at =PrincefooterText_xx= | _TML_ |
| =PrincefooterText_xx= %BR% =PrincefooterText_en= %BR% =PrincefooterText_de= %BR% =PrincefooterText_default= | With the default =Princefooter= one of these definitions will be printed on the bottom of the page according to the =%%NOP%CONTENT_LANGUAGE%=.%BR%If =%%NOP%CONTENT_LANGUAGE%= is set to 'de' the definition =PrincefooterText_de= will be used, when it is set to 'en' it will use =PrincefooterText_en= etc.. When =%%NOP%CONTENT_LANGUAGE%= is set to 'fr' but there is no =PrincefooterText_fr= it will default to =PrincefooterText_default=.%BR%You can add any =PrincefooterText_xx= you like. | _TML_ |
| *page counter* |||
| =printPageCounter= | This is the content of the page counter that you can print with =%%NOP%TMPL:P{"modacPageNr"}%=.%BR%If you only want to modify the text you probably want to change =printPageCounter_xx= instead. | _TML_ |
| =printPageCounter_xx= %BR% =printPageCounter_en= %BR% =printPageCounter_de= %BR% =printPageCounter_default= | When the default =printPageCounter= is used one of these definitions will be used according to the =%%NOP%CONTENT_LANGUAGE%=.%BR%As with =PrincefooterText_xx= you can add any language you like. | _TML_ |

---+++ Hiding stuff in the printout
If you add the _css-class_ =modacPrintHide= to your element it will be hidden in the printout.
