---++ Usage
This Plugin is designed to work along with GenPDFPrincePlugin and check image permissions.
<p>It will rewrite the source in img-tags to reference to local files on the server eg. =img src='/bin/viewfile/Main/Topic/MyPicture.png'= will become =img src='file:///path/to/Foswiki/pub/Main/Topic/MyPicture.png'= *IF* the user has the required permissions to view that file.
</p>
When access is denied the image will be replaced with an error-image. You can set that image in configure.

---++ Installation Instructions
Install GenPDFPrincePlugin and this Plugin.
<br />
In Configure set
<verbatim>
{PluginsOrder} = ...,MAPrinceModPlugin, GenPDFPrincePlugin
</verbatim>
so this plugin executes before Prince.
